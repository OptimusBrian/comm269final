         Richard Wilson opened the first Maple Grove Diner in 1953 on Monroe Avenue in Rochester. He also loved Maple trees and deemed it fitting to name his first restaurant, "Maple Grove" after the foliage surrounding the area. The restaurant became well-known for its unique maple syrup and amazing comfort food. As the restaraunt's popularity grew, so did the Wilson family. Richard and his wife, Sarah, had five children: Roger, Lillian, James, Elizabeth, and David. The kids loved going to the diner with their parents and when they became teenagers, they all worked in the diner to help support their parents and maintain the quality of Maple Grove. Once they were old enough, each sibling opened their own Maple Grove Diners in locations around eastern New York. These locations are Webster, Greece, Henrietta, Fairport, and Chili. Richard and Sarah retired in 1980 and live in Rochester with their black lab Bo. But the legacy lives on. All six locations are still open and maintain the goals of the first Maple Grove. Their main focus is creating family-friendly environments and fully dedicating themselves to serving their communities.
